# Network View Dotted Pattern Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a lightweight dotted pattern background for the network view canvas without impacting performance.

## Implementation Details

### Inline Styles Approach
- Uses CSS `radial-gradient` for hardware-accelerated rendering
- No additional DOM elements required
- Scales smoothly with zoom operations
- Minimal memory footprint
- JavaScript-based responsive design for dynamic pattern sizing

### Performance Benefits
1. **Hardware Acceleration**: CSS gradients are GPU-accelerated
2. **No DOM Overhead**: Unlike SVG patterns, no additional elements
3. **Smooth Scaling**: Pattern scales with zoom without performance impact
4. **Memory Efficient**: Minimal memory usage compared to SVG patterns
5. **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes and DPI

### Pattern Themes
- **Default**: Light gray dots (#e5e7eb) on white background
- **Dark**: Dark gray dots (#374151) for dark theme
- **Subtle**: Very light dots (#f3f4f6) for minimal visual impact

### Responsive Design
- Mobile devices: 15px pattern size
- High DPI displays: 10px pattern size
- Standard displays: 20px pattern size

### Usage
The pattern is applied via inline styles and can be toggled through the controls panel. The implementation automatically handles different screen sizes and zoom levels using JavaScript-based responsive design.

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### SVG Pattern (Rejected)
- Creates additional DOM elements
- Higher memory usage
- Performance impact with zoom operations
- More complex implementation

### Canvas Pattern (Rejected)
- Requires manual drawing
- No hardware acceleration
- Complex zoom handling
- Higher CPU usage

### CSS Grid Pattern (Rejected)
- More complex CSS
- Limited browser support
- Performance issues with large areas

## Best Practices
1. Use CSS gradients for simple patterns
2. Leverage hardware acceleration
3. Keep DOM elements minimal
4. Implement responsive design
5. Consider accessibility (pattern doesn't interfere with content)
